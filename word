[生存游戏]
your name is chris,and you are in a small plane,going across the Rocky Mountains.
Suddenly the engine starts to make strange noises and the plane begins to go down into one of the mountains.
Your radio does not work,and nobody knows where you are.
You walk for about twenty minutes,wearing the coat and carrying the whisky and the map.
The snow is deep and you are very cold.
You go back to the plane and get some different things.
You want to get warm and you drink the whisky.
You go back to sleep. You don't hear the helicopter again. The next day you walk down the river again.
You walk back out of the tunnel and into the rocky valley.
You eat the fruit. It isn't very good, but you're very hungry so you eat a lot. You take some with you. You can eat it later.
It's evening again, but because of the fish you are not hungry.You make a small house under the trees.  You wake up early in the morning.There's a lot of noise.
You run out and look up. There's a helicopter in the sky. You can see it, but it can't see you because of the trees, and it is going away.
You run after the helicopter
You go back to sleep
You build a big fire
You shout at the helicopter and wave your arms
